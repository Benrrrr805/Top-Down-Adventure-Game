# File Structure Documentation for Top-Down Adventure Game

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the file structure for a basic top-down adventure game. The structure is designed to be modular, maintainable, scalable, and easy to navigate for both new and experienced developers. By adhering to this structure, you can efficiently manage your game's components and ensure a smooth development workflow.

### 1. **main.py**

- The main entry point for the game.
- Responsible for initializing Pygame, setting up the game window, and starting the primary game loop.
- Acts as the central hub, calling upon other modules to manage various aspects of the game.
- Example tasks:
  - Handling command-line arguments.
  - Transitioning between different game states (e.g., menu, gameplay).

### 2. **game/**

- Houses the core logic and essential components of the game.
- Organized into submodules for clarity and reusability.

#### 2.1 `core.py`

- Defines the main `Game` class, which manages the lifecycle of the game.
- Handles initialization, the primary game loop, and communication between different modules.
- Facilitates interactions with other components, such as using `entities` to update and render game objects or leveraging `scenes` to transition between game states.
- Includes methods for:
  - Updating game logic.
  - Rendering visuals.
  - Processing user input. Defines the main `Game` class, which manages the lifecycle of the game.
- Handles initialization, the primary game loop, and communication between different modules.
- Includes methods for:
  - Updating game logic.
  - Rendering visuals.
  - Processing user input.

#### 2.2 `settings.py`

- Centralizes game configuration and constants.
- Includes:
  - Screen dimensions (e.g., `SCREEN_WIDTH`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT`).
  - Frame rate (`FPS`).
  - Predefined color values for consistency (e.g., `COLORS = {'WHITE': (255, 255, 255), ...}`).
- Facilitates easy adjustments without modifying multiple files.

### 3. **entities/**

- Contains definitions for game objects, such as the player, enemies, and NPCs.
- Each file corresponds to a specific entity type, ensuring modularity.

#### 3.1 `player.py`

- Implements the `Player` class, which manages:
  - Player-specific attributes like health, speed, and inventory.
  - Movement mechanics, including collision detection.
  - Interaction with other game objects and the environment.

#### 3.2 `enemy.py`

- Implements the `Enemy` class, which governs:
  - Enemy behaviors such as patrolling, chasing, or attacking.
  - AI logic for decision-making.
  - Rendering and animation.

### 4. **scenes/**

- Manages different game states, such as menus, levels, and pause screens.
- Each scene is encapsulated in its own file for clarity and scalability.

#### 4.1 `menu.py`

- Implements the `MenuScene` class, which:
  - Displays menu options and transitions between game states.
  - Processes input for navigation (e.g., keyboard, mouse).
  - Handles visual elements like background images or animated titles.

#### 4.2 `level_one.py`

- Implements the `LevelOne` class, responsible for:
  - Level-specific setup, such as loading assets and initializing objects.
  - Managing gameplay elements unique to the level (e.g., puzzles, enemy waves).
  - Monitoring the player's progress and triggering events.

### 5. **utils/**

- Provides helper functions and reusable utilities to streamline development.

#### 5.1 `helpers.py`

- Common functions include:
  - `load_image(file_path)`: Simplifies image loading and error handling.
  - `load_sound(file_path)`: Streamlines audio loading.
  - Utility methods for mathematical calculations or data formatting.

### 6. **assets/**

- Stores external resources, ensuring separation from the codebase.
- Subdirectories:
  - `images/`: Sprites, backgrounds, and UI elements.
  - `sounds/`: Sound effects and music tracks.
  - `fonts/`: Font files for text rendering.
- Ensures organized and consistent asset management.

### 7. **requirements.txt**

- Lists all project dependencies.
- Facilitates environment setup with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Example content:
  ```
  pygame
  numpy
  ```
- Update this file as new dependencies are added.

## Usage

### 1. Setup

- Ensure Python and Pygame are installed.
- Install dependencies using:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 2. Run

- Start the game by executing:
  ```
  python main.py
  ```

### 3. Extend

- To add new features:
  - **Scenes**: Create a new file in `scenes/` and define a class for the scene.
  - **Entities**: Add a new file in `entities/` for the object, and implement its logic.
  - **Assets**: Place new resources in the appropriate subdirectory under `assets/` and update code references.

### 4. Debug

- Use logging or breakpoints to identify and resolve issues.
- Regularly test new features to ensure they integrate smoothly.

## Benefits of This Structure

- **Clarity**: Each module has a clear purpose, making the code easier to navigate.
- **Modularity**: Components can be developed, tested, and reused independently.
- **Scalability**: Supports adding new features without significant restructuring.
- **Maintainability**: Organized structure reduces technical debt and simplifies debugging.

This structure ensures a solid foundation for building and maintaining a robust top-down adventure game.
